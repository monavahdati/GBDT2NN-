# LightGBM + Neural Network (GBDT2NN) for BNPL Credit Classification ðŸ’³ðŸ§ 

This repository demonstrates a hybrid machine learning architecture where LightGBM is used to learn tree-based patterns, and a deep neural network further learns interactions using the leaf indices and raw features.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- LightGBM learns structure in the data and outputs leaf indices per tree.
- These leaf indices are embedded and used as inputs to a DNN (like categorical embeddings).
- The model predicts credit eligibility for BNPL offers.
- Visual and explainable analysis with SHAP + KS + ROC + PR curves.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- PyTorch (DNN & embeddings)
- LightGBM (GBDT leaf extraction)
- SHAP (explainability)
- Scikit-learn (evaluation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualizations)
